# Countdown Numbers C++

I decided that it was time to learn C++. This is my first C++ program - a simple solver for the numbers game from countdown. The numbers provided in the prompt should be separated by hyphens.

Currently just a basic BFS search but I will optimise it with a heuristic like my python equivalent later on.
